Integration of code reviews into development process can enhance code quality.
Code reviews are integrated as part of the public tools and repositories, such as GitLab or GitHub.

This can be sufficient for day to day operation, but it is not suitable for external or complete reviews.
Objective is to create an online tool that would address this short coming.
