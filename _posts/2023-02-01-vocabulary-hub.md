One of the core principles of linked data is to employ vocabularies to describe data in a machine-readable way.
By doing so, data producers can significantly enhance data usability and interoperability.
Findable, Interoperable, Accessible, and Reusable, or FAIR in short, vocabularies are enablers of the aforementioned.
However, many vocabularies are not published in an easy-to-consume way.
As a result, data publishers often resort to the design of their new proprietary vocabulary.
While feasible, this approach decreases the value we would get from reuse and hinders data interoperability.
The objective of this project is to tackle those issues.

As the problem is quite complex it is not expected that it could be tackled by a single project or researcher by top-down approach.
Instead we should focus on bottom-up approach by proposing and implementing partial solutions in separate projects.

In this project we focus on sharing the vocabulary using a shared repository, called vocabulary hub. 
What vocabulary hub exactly is and how it could be used should be specified as a part of the project.
Anyway I would like to hint a few ideas:
* User can store reference to their vocabulary in vocabulary hub.
* User can store their vocabulary in vocabulary hub.
* User can utilize vocabulary hub as a "proxy" for dereferencing vocabularies.
* User can search in stored vocabularies.

As a part of the analysis we also need to inspect existing solutions such as:
* https://lov.linkeddata.es/dataset/lov/

Here is a list of soma additional, semi-random ideas:
* Vocabulary hub should allow for search using example data or example vocabularies.
  Overall the idea is to make it easy for user to find vocabulary to employ.
* Vocabulary hub should not be limited only to vocabularies. 
  It should support also conceptual/logical models.
