# Text quality

Regardless of the type of the thesis, there are rules that apply in general.

## Grammar

Utilize [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/) [EN] / [Korektor](https://lindat.mff.cuni.cz/services/korektor/) [CS] for spell and grammar checking.
If you do use any tool to correct your text, you should declare it in the thesis.

## One sentence per line

This is important so please, write one sentence per one line.
This allows you to easily spot short, repetitive or long sentences.
It is also easy to comment.

## How many pages?

The first think to state is, that there is no hard lower, or upper, limit to the number of pages.
The number of pages is not a relevant indicator the the quality of the text.
In fact, it is easy to write a lot of low quality pages.
It is just about time, there is no demonstrated skill.
On the other hand, writing a single high quality page may requires multiple rewrites.

With that said, the number of pages should be between 50 to 60.
Anything bellow 40 is probably too short, unless it is theoretical work.
Anything over 80 is probably too much.
Try to view the page number from the perspective or a supervisor or an opponent.
Would you rather read 50 pages of enjoyable text, or spend hours reading poorly written thesis of 120 pages?

## Illustrations

It is a good idea to utilize illustrations in your thesis.
In general the illustration may be a screenshot or a diagram.

For screenshots use lossless format like PNG, do not use JPEG.
Also make sure that all images are of sufficient resolution.

For diagrams and other graphics, like graphs, use of vector graphic formats, like SVG.

## Diagrams

You may utilize diagrams to illustrate architecture of your system, communication within a system, etc..
Do not reinvent the wheel with a custom notation.
Drawing bunch of boxes and connecting them with lines is not a good idea.

The best option is to employ standardized and well known graphical notation.
You probably already know UML, that is definitely an options.
Yet, UML is quite complex and thus may not be a good fit.

You should utilize [C4 model](https://c4model.com/) to communicate architecture of your solution.
Instead of drawing the diagram using a graphical editor, you can employ [Structurizr](https://structurizr.com/).
Structurizr allows you to describe your architecture using Domain Specific Language (DSL).
Once you describe your architecture you can generate multiple views.
This is important, as you should customize each diagram to communicate exactly the information you want to whoever you want.

## Generative AI

The text in the thesis must be written by you.
You must be a sole author of the text.
At the same time you can use AI to help you with structure or suggest changes to improve the text quality.
In fact the above mentioned Grammarly also can utilize AI.
If you do use any tool to correct your text, you should declare it in the thesis.

## Synonyms

When introducing a new term you must either cite a source or provide a definition.
Once you define a term, use it.
Do not change the meaning of once a term has been defined.
Do not use synonyms!

## Never put two headings below each other

The title should be self-explanatory.
If you feel like there is nothing to put you are probably wrong.
