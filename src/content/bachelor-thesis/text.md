# Text
While the type of the thesis determines the content of the text part, some rules apply regardless of the content.

## Editor and LaTeX
I do recommend use of [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/).
It is an online tool with the ability to add comments.

You may also want to employ [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/) [EN] / [Korektor](https://lindat.mff.cuni.cz/services/korektor/) [CS] for spell and grammar checking.

## One sentence per line
This is important so please, write sentence per line.
This allows you to easily spot short, repetitive or long sentences.

## How many pages?
The first think to state is, that there is no hard lower, or upper, limit to the number of pages.
The number of pages is not a relevant indicator the the quality of the text.
In fact, it is easy to write a lot of low quality pages.
It is just about time, there is no demonstrated skill.
On the other hand, writing a single high quality page may requires multiple rewrites.

With that said, the number of pages should be between 50 to 60.
Anything bellow 30 is probably too short, unless it is theoretical work.
Anything over 80 is probably too much.
Try to view the page number from the perspective or a supervisor or an opponent.
Would you rather read 50 pages of enjoyable text, or spend hours reading poorly written thesis of 120 pages?

## Illustrations
It is a good idea to utilize illustrations in your thesis.
In general the illustration may be a screenshot or a diagram.

For screenshots use lossless format like PNG, do not use JPEG.
Also make sure that the image is of sufficient resolution.

As for diagrams and other graphics, like graphs, use of vector graphic formats, like SVG, is almost must.

## Diagrams
You may utilize diagrams to illustrate architecture of your system, communication within a system, etc..
Do not reinvent the wheel with a custom notation.
Drawing bunch of boxes and connecting them with lines is not a good idea.

The best option is to employ standardized and well known graphical notation.
You probably already know UML, that is definitely an options.
Yet, UML is quite complex and thus may not be a good fit.

You should utilize [C4 model](https://c4model.com/) to communicate architecture of your solution.
Instead of drawing the diagram using a graphical editor, you can employ [Structurizr](https://structurizr.com/).
Structurizr allows you to describe your architecture using Domain Specific Language (DSL).
Once you describe your architecture you can generate multiple views.
This is important, as you should customize each diagram to communicate exactly the information you want to whoever you want.

## Generative AI
The text in the thesis must be written by you.
You must be a sole author of the text.

## Synonyms
When introducing a new term you must either cite a source or provide a definition.
Once you define a term, use it.
Do not change the meaning of once a term has been defined.
Do not use synonyms.
