# Getting started

The objective of this website is to help you start working on your semestral project or a thesis.
Please employ this website as a check list, each section represent something you should do.

## Create a repository

Made your code available to the public.
You can use [GitHub](https://github.com/) or [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/).
You may even consider setting up [personal profile page](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/setting-up-your-profile) and adding the thesis repository to your portfolio.

In addition, your repository should contain a license, like the [MIT](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).
You should put the license into `LICENSE` file in root of the repository.
The must have for each repository is also a `README.md` file.

Do not worry too much about naming the repository, you can change the name later.

## Commit to the repository

What is this about, you probably know how to `git commit`, right?
If not there are two important things to keep in mind.

- Commit small functional changes..
  If you can not commit functional code every day your are probably doing it wrong.
  Also do not commit by time, really focus on the functional change or refactoring.

- Use meaningful commit messages.
  A good commit message has a short file line, like a title.
  This line is followed by an empty line and a description
  There are plenty of posts about this on the internet.
  You may draw inspiration from [How to Write a Git Commit Message](https://cbea.ms/git-commit/).
  Seriously read it!

## Write a diary

Make regular notes on your progress!
Read something interesting; note it down.
Tried something that does not work; note it down.
Found a similar tool or related article?
You guessed it, not to mention it down!

## Create an Overleaf project

I do recommend use of [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/).
It is an online tool for LaTex compilation with the ability to add comments.
There is also a thesis template somewhere you can use.

## Send me an e-mail

Send me an e-mail with links to your repository and overleaf project.

You sent the e-mail, but there is no response from me, what now?
You probably know the scene from Shrek 2.
If you do not know it, just search for it.
The point is that the Donkey keeps asking in semi-regular intervals.
I do my best to read all emails and respond in time.
Yet, if you send me an email and there is no response within 2 working days, just send a reminder.
If there is still no response, send another one, and again, and again ..
