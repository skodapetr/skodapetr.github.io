# Software

Following is the list of my expectations on software.
Some of them are more opinionated then others.
Keep in mind these are only recommendation.

## Use version control

You must use a version control software.
Commit small functional changes with meaningful messages.
There are plenty of posts about this on the internet.
You may draw inspiration from [How to Write a Git Commit Message](https://cbea.ms/git-commit/).

## Repository

Made your code available to the public.
You can use [GitHub](https://github.com/) or [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/).
You may even consider setting up [personal profile page](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/setting-up-your-profile) and adding the thesis repository to your portfolio.

In addition, your repository should contain a license, like the [MIT](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).
You should put the license into `LICENSE` file in root of the repository.

It is best to setup the repository at the start of the project.

## Deployment

When possible use [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to distribute your application.
You can utilize [GitHub Packages](https://github.com/features/packages) to host your images.
