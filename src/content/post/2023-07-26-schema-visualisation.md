There are many ways how to define a data schema: JSON Schema, RDFS, or code.
We also have plenty of visualisation techniques like UML or ER-Model.
So it should be simple to take your schema and visualise it right?
Well, I've tried and I was unable to find, as of 2023, any suitable online tool to get the job done.
We can try to change this together.

Notes:
- In addition to visualisation user should be able to edit the schema. <br/>
  Export options to different schemas (JSON Schema, RDFS, ...) can be limited.

This topic can be expanded to Master thesis by allowing schema evolution.
