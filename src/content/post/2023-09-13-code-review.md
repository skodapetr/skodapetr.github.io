Integration of code reviews into development process can enhance code quality.
Code reviews are integrated as part of the public tools and repositories, such as GitLab or GitHub.
Yet often code review is limited to the scope of a change, like a pull request.
This can be sufficient for day to day operation, but it is not suitable for external or complete reviews.
Objective is to create an online tool that would address this short coming.

There is a tool called [Review Board](https://github.com/reviewboard/reviewboard) which seems to provide similar functionality.

This post is a [stub](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Stub).
I may add more information later.
Feel free to reach out to me to discuss this topic further.
