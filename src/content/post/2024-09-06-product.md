This post is basically a pointer to the [Product Vision vs. Mission](https://www.svpg.com/product-vision-vs-mission/) page.
To use the same quote as the page.
<blockquote cite="Antoine de Saint-ExupÃ©ry">
If you want to build a ship, don't drum up the men to gather wood, divide the work, and give orders.
Instead, teach them to yearn for the vast and endless sea.
</blockquote>

In the page author, Marty Cagan, explains the difference between product vision and mission statement.
To quote;
<blockquote cite="Marty Cagan">
Most people I meet, when they show me their "product vision", what they are really showing me is their "mission statement".
They are confusing a slogan about their purpose, with a product vision.
</blockquote>

It may be useful to revisit this page whenever starting a new project to formulate those two.
