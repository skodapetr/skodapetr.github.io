  <h1>Disclaimer</h1>
	<p>
		There is no quality control for most of the content not only on this site, but in the whole blog / repository.
	</p>
  <p>
    In the best case scenario I have used a spell checker and eyeballed the content once before publishing it.
    As a result, there are probably grammar mistakes and a lot of typos all round.

    Yet, perhaps this is intentional, in order to show you that you do not need C2 or C1 in order to write.
    At the end of the day, you may hardly become a good writer without writing.
    And I probably do not need to explain the importance of ability to express yourself using a language.
  </p>
  <p>
    There is plethora of high quality blogs, and articles.
    Nevertheless, perhaps what we need is also the opposite end of the spectrum.
    The lower quality ones, where we can see the errors and mistakes.
    Perhaps the lower quality help somebody adjust their expectation.
    Perhaps after reading a bit, you find yourself thinking you can do better and perhaps, you decide to give it a try ... üôè
