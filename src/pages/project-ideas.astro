  <h1>Projects ideas</h1>
  <p>
    This site hosts a list of project ideas suitable for a bachelor's or master's thesis.
    Feel free to contact me should you find any of them interesting.
  </p>

  <p class="danger">
    As of now, I've almost reached the limit of students for a bachelor thesis.
    As a result, I am likely to turn you down when it comes to supervising a bachelor thesis.
  </p>

  <p>
    While the bachelor's thesis can be research or implementation-based, the master's thesis is expected to be research-based.
    In other words, the author of the master's thesis should deal with higher risk connected with exploring the unknown.
    With that said, it is still possible to have an implementation-based master thesis.
    I suggested the expected type using tags attached to each entry.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you are not sure what a bachelor's thesis looks like, feel free to read my notes on <a href="./bachelor-thesis/" target="_blank">bachelor thesis</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    I do my best to keep the list up to date.
    For some topics, there is space for multiple theses.
    As a result, more than one student can work on a thesis inspired by the same idea.
    The "Under&nbsp;negotiation" tag means that I've been contacted by a student who expressed interest in the given topic.
    As a result the topic, or its part, may become unavailable to other students.

      If you do not find the above topics interesting, or there are not topics, you can pitch me yours.
      Be aware that I prefer my topics, therefore, make sure your topic and pitch is a good one.
